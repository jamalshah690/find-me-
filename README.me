State Management Approach: GetX

This combination of GetX and Hive ensures efficiency,
scalability, and a seamless developer experience for 
CRUD operations.


Workflow:
1) Model: Define JobModel for data representation.
2) Repository: Handle data persistence with Hive.
3) Controller: Use GetX to manage the state and encapsulate business logic for CRUD operations.
4) View: Observe the controller's reactive variables to update the UI in real-time.


Example:
When a job is added:
Controller calls the repository to save the data to Hive.
jobList is updated using loadJobs() after the save operation.
The UI listens to jobList changes (thanks to .obs) and 
automatically refreshes to show the updated job list.
